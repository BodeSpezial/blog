In recent years it has gotten really popular to talk about "getting offended" and how it harms everything from public discourse to comedy and even scientific progress.
And while I certainly read some pretty outlandish stories where corrections were made to be "less offensive" I still feel like a lot of the discussion about it comes from the people who (claim to) defend "free speech" and complain that "nothing can be said anymore" while reality is often more harmless or nuanced.

Today I want to take a closer look at some of the points I have heard which seemed a bit shallow to me.

## "History has shown that eccentric people bring us forward"

This is something I hear primarily from "science bubble".

And the first thing that really strikes me about it is that I felt like especially scientific-minded people would reject an "argument from tradition" while this point really looks like one in my eyes.
Either I misunderstand the point that is supposed to be made here or the validity of it is already pretty corrupted by the fact that it just says "but it worked for the last x years".
And without dragging it out too much: That is not an argument. That's nostalgia in the best case and stubbornness in the worst. "Good"^[Independent from the goal <~~ockhams~~ guillotine>.] things prove their value not by time but by withstanding challenge.

And I find such a glaring fallacy a bit weird for people who pride themselves in "logical/scientific thinking".

But even ignoring this I would even say that this point has two other potential flaws.

First: It doesn't necessarily speak in favor of "Offensiveness".
E.g.: Alan Turing. Only decades after his death were we able to look at ourselves and see that we might have screwed up a tiny bit.
It wasn't his eccentricity that was persecuted but his sexual orientation.
But he probably still had to struggle quite a big bit with the fact that he didn't conform to what was expected from him.

<!-- And if we already go ahead and compare offense and being offended. Alan Turing would have desperately needed the people that are put off as "too sensible" today because of his sexual orientation.-->


Second: Do we really have a comparison?
Science should always look for proof^[citation needed]. Social sciences do that by comparing different groups of people with as few free variables as possible.
And this point basically revolves around the fact that we did not have this comparison until now and are now bothered by the work that this comparison brings with or the possibility that it might work.

## Closing thoughts

After all..

There is certainly much more to the discussion and this article also only represents some of the thoughts I have about the topic.

But in general I would not say that humanity - whether today or in history - can really pride itself in civil communication.
As much as we try (or claim to try) to be nice to each other and have logical discussions about good, bad and the overall state of the world we often fall back into comfortable but wrong patterns.
So I would say before we put our fingers in our ears and defend ourselves against the cruel young people who are so foolish and sensible we should maybe take a step back and think about if we want to prove Thomas Hooke^[humans are their own worst enemy] right or not.
