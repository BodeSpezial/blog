I recently started re-watching the absurdly hilarious TV-Series 'Taskmaster'.
I already knew that I really liked it but I finally decided to write down my thoughts about it.

## Comedy lives from surprises

A key part of the show is that a lot of it is unscripted (or that's at least what's very believably conveyed. There are some pretty unhinged moments in the show where it would be hard to argue that it is not.).
Previous contestants have said that they are contractually not allowed to talk to the others about the tasks until the taping of the in-studio show.
And from some of the reactions it's pretty clear that that's also actually happening.

This suspense that only the contestants themselves know what they did until it's shown on the screen (and in more than one case even they themself forget) makes a for some great moments.

## How to get in?

The first episode is actually a pretty good entry into the series.
I don't want to spoil any of the great moments but there are some reoccurring themes throughout the now 12 series spanning show which can already be seen in the first episode(s).
