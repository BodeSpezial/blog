## Intro

I finished watching "Tear along the dotted line" yesterday and: It. Was. Something!!

I had already in mind to write about it's beautiful storytelling and art style.
But after I decided to casually finish it while doing something else - which I can't even recall by now - the end left me so.. stunned that I HAVE to watch it again and then talk about it with the deserving focus.

As always I try to keep it as vague as possible.
You won't hear anything directly about the story but I might not be able to accurately describe the series without at least some insights.

If you are like me and don't watch or read anything about a piece of media when you already know you're going to watch it you should only read up to [[A glimpse at the story]] where I'll won't be able to avoid some insights.

## Art Style

### Backgrounds

## Storytelling

### Verbildlichter innerer Monolog

### What red line?

Teils ganze Folgen springen unangekündigt in die Vergangenheit, so dass man erst am Ende oder gar zu Beginn der nächsten Folge merkt, dass es ein Rückblick war.
Besonders stark, wenn man es nicht am Stück schaut.

### Narrator

Don't giving a flying duck about the 4th wall

## A glimpse at the story

Wie aus ohnehin schon tiefgehend ("Abenteuer eines mittelalten Junggesellen") & witzig plötzlich noch viel, viel tiefgehender mit dem Ende wird.
