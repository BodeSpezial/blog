As far as I can think back I read.
As soon as I could read I basically wasn't seen without a book.
Sadly I'm reading quite a bit less nowadays because I don't really give me the time to dive in anymore. (Hopefullly that'll change again in the future.)

But nevertheless I have a lot of books to recommend, a selection of which you'll find here.
