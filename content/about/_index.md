# about

I'm a novice web dev tipping his toes in the dark, colorful space that is the Internet.

I like to learn a lot of stuff (often broadly related to math, physics, computer science, keyboards, hardware in general, psychology, comedy or movies [somewhat in order]) while still fullfilling my day job.

If you want to know what I'm up to at the moment just head over to the [now](/now) page.
